# US, HIKERS!
## A fictional outdoors-themed blog

### Description
The final school project meant to showcase my proficiency in coding and design, integrating 
the skills acquired in the first semester, and the latest knowledge acquired during the 
second semester. 

A school project to practice asynchronous JavaScript and the Fetch API, modular JS, Firebase for back-end services, Git to manage the project.

### Working process
Firstly I decided to use webpack and babel, succesfully, so I added firebase services for authentification, and implemented log/sign in/out, which were working as supposed to, 
but then changed my mind and swithed to parcel bundler (because I can). 

At the same time also created a twin-project using webpack and babel, just in case parcel won't cooperate in the first project, and implemented a weather-widget feature there. 
After that I decided to add firebase to this twin-project and made a huge mess. After wasting the whole two days trying to fix the issue I decided I don't really like webpack that much and returned to the parcel project. This one.
### Summary

### Conclusion
Copying things from one project to another is a bad idea.

AI is not going to steal anyones job in the near future.
