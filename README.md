### Working process
Firstly I decided to use webpack and babel, succesfully, so I added firebase services for authentification, and implemented log/sign in/out, which were working as supposed to, 
but then changed my mind and swithed to parcel bundler (because I can). 

At the same time also created a twin-project using webpack and babel, https://github.com/TetianaKoliesnik/Us-Hikers-Webpack just in case parcel won't cooperate in the first project,and implemented a weather-widget feature there. 
After that I decided to add firebase to this project and made a huge mess. After wasting the whole two days trying to fix the issue I decided I don't really like webpack that much and returned to the parcel project. This one.
